# Jennifer (Jen) Wanner – Writing Portfolio

## 👋 About Me

I'm a technical writer with experience creating knowledge base articles, how-to guides, and standard operating procedures (SOPs) for Information Systems Support and Consumer Relations teams in the Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) industry. My work helps internal support professionals troubleshoot issues efficiently and empowers customer-facing teams with clear, structured documentation.

I specialize in breaking down complex workflows into easy-to-follow steps and have a strong focus on clarity, consistency, and usability.

## 📘 Writing Samples
The following samples are demonstrations created to showcase my writing ability, as much of my past work is proprietary.
