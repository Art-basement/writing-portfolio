# Symptom Categories:  CONNECTIVITY > BROADBAND > HOME WITHOUT CORPORATE BROADBAND

## START OF SOLUTION SCRIPT
      
**DESCRIPTION:** Information Services has begun a program of deploying a standard set of equipment for a limited number of users, enabling them to connect remotely over a broadband service using iPass. 
I.S. will ONLY provide support for _Corporate-installed_ broadband service and equipment. Use this article when the caller indicates that they do **NOT** have corporate supplied broadband equipment.
   
## ISOLATION/RESOLUTION STEPS:
   
1. If the client has questions or issues about broadband use or service, explain that we only support the corporate installed set of equipment and service.
2. All other attempts to use iPass over broadband is not supported by the IS Team. Tell the caller:
   
> Using a broadband connection to the Hershey network WITHOUT using the standard set of Hershey-provided equipment is a security risk to Hershey's systems.  We don't support this environment, and we recommend that callers do not continue to attempt a broadband connection without the Hershey-provided set of router and UPS devices" 
   
Advise the caller to use iPass over a normal dial-up scenario.  If pushed, the technical reason is that the client does not have an approved firewall.  The unit we are supplying does more than a common cable/dsl router.
